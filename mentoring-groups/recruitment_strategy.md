### Recruiting mentors

Dear [INSERT FIRST NAME]

Carpentries mentoring groups have been extremely successful, and we have used the feedback we received from both mentors and mentees to craft a new and improved mentoring experience for both mentors and mentees in round two.

We’d like to invite you to lead a mentoring group! With your leadership, participants have the opportunity to learn from each other and reach specific goals around teaching, lesson maintenance, workshop operations, and/or community building.

Our mentors are experienced instructors who are committed to helping others become engaged members of the Carpentries community. Mentors have told us they really enjoy being involved with this program. 
                   
We invite you to lead a mentoring group. If you are interested in learning more, please sign up for the information session on [XXX] via this Etherpad [1]. If you would like to be involved, but can’t attend the information session, please let us know. The deadline to sign up to be a mentor is [XXX]. To sign up, simply complete the Google form for mentors [2].
                                     
We are looking forward to seeing you at an information session!
                   
Sincerely,  
Kari L. Jordan

### Recruiting mentees

Dear [INSERT NAME],

Welcome, and thank you for joining the Carpentries community! We are delighted that you share our vision of bringing computational and data literacy to the global research community.

We invite you to join a mentoring group. We match new instructors with experienced community members who can answer questions about the Carpentries related to teaching, lesson maintenance, organizing workshops, and community building. If possible, we will try to match you with people close by to help strengthen your local Carpentries community.

Your mentor will hold regular meetings with your mentoring group (these are usually small - around 4-5 people) to help prepare you to teach or to maintain lessons, depending on which group you sign up for. Mentors might hold practice teaching sessions or Q&A sessions on lesson content. They may walk you through workshop logistics, or help you create workshop websites. Each group will work differently as the mentor will try to meet the needs of individual groups.

We strongly encourage you to take advantage of our mentoring groups. If you are interested in joining, please sign up via this Google form [1].

Mentors are dedicated, experienced instructors who are committed to helping you become engaged members of the Carpentries community. We are confident that you will benefit from their experience. Spaces in the program are limited, so please sign up as soon as you can. The deadline for applications is [XXX].

Still not sure? We will be offering an information session on [XXX]. You can bring any questions you have to that session. All the details of time zone conversion and how to connect are on this Etherpad [2]. 

We look forward to having you in the program!

Regards,  
Kari L. Jordan
